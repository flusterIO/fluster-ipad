<Admonition title="Coming Soon" titleClasses="bg-red-400">
    API's in Typescript, Python and Go will be available soon with support for plugins as well so users and developers can extend the embeddedable components. Expect support in late fall or early winter.

Fluster was built extensibility being one of the primary concerns. Fluster provides a set of API's in typescript, Rust, Go and Python for you to build all of the tools necessary to make Fluster fit your workflow. This is made possible by the FFI/Rust ecosystem, meaning that your tools will execute Rust no matter the language you choose.

While providing these API's to the developer community is a priority, I'm choosing to focus my attention to internal tools first. The architecture is in place to quickly generate these API's, but for now I will return to this when the core functionality of the application is out of $\beta$.


Please be patient with my while I do my best to catch up on the documentation, and if you really want to speed up the process, consider becoming a sponsor! Nothing slows down progress more than being homeless.
