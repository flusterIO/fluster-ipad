If you've never written `jsx` before, don't worry, Fluster's got you covered there too. Fluster includes it's own set of embedded documentation, available to you directly within the app completely offline, with a complete guide to jsx for begginners. To be clear, you don't need to know how to write much `jsx` at all. `jsx` can be quite complicated, as it's just a superset of a full programming language (javascript), but you don't need to know a single line of javascript. 

The 'x' in mdx is one of the key features that sets Fluster apart from other markdown based note taking applications. This added support of jsx opens the door to entirely new possibilities that just aren't possible with a markdown based app, but it does require an additional learning curve. Don't worry, this learning curve is no more complicated than it was to learn markdown.

To learn more about jsx, checkout the embedded documentation available via the command palette. For those looking to go deeper, React tutorials on youtube might be of more value than researching mdx directly, as the 'x' in the case of Fluster is really just React. You don't need to know how to create your own components to use Fluster, just how to insert them where you want them to appear in your notes. That's not to say you _can't_ learn to create your own components and _extend_ Fluster though, as plugin support will be available shortly.
