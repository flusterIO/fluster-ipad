    Fluster includes it's own set of embedded documentation available via the command palette (cmd+p by default). This online documentation is just a subset of the much more thorough embedded documentation.

Fluster aims to be an accessible presentation layer for whatever you need to jot down, organize and reference later. To accomplish this, Fluster relies on `.mdx` as the most commonly used input. [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com) works as a superset of markdown, allowing all of the familiar markdown features with the added support for React components.

Fluster then embeds this React app in a Rust powered tauri application, stores your notes in a local vector database and uses (for now, local only) AI to provide you with insights into your data without ever contacting an outside service.


## First Steps

> **Note**: If you're on mac, you'll have to open your system settings and white-list Fluster in the privacy tab. This is only because I'm still homeless and I can't afford an Apple developer license.

First, continue to our [downloads page](https://github.com/flusterIO/fluster/releases) and use the table to select the appropriate file for your operating system. This will download the core Fluster application.

During this onboarding process, a screen should be presented asking among other things where you plan to keep your notes. For portability, Fluster insists that you keep all of your notes within a single parent directory, but notes can be organized within this directory however you like, including within deeply nested folders.

### Create your first note

Creating a note couldn't be simpler! Just create a file with the `.mdx` extension anywhere within the directory you provided to Fluster, and Fluster will find this note in a variety of ways, depending on the sync methods used since this file was created. The following table demonstrates the type of syncing required for each search feature.

| Search Type | Required Sync |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Semantic | Sync with AI |
| Text based (traditional search) | Sync with/without AI |
| File System based search | No sync required |

> As is covered in the embedded documentation, the sync 'without AI' method was created to work around the incredible demanding and time consuming task generating database vectors can be on personal hardware. Syncing with AI can take upwards of 15 minutes, while syncing without AI can be ran in a few seconds even for hundreds of notes.

### Front Matter

Mdx uses a `yaml` like syntax to define what is known as _front matter_. You can read more about the specific front matter fields [here](/docs/user/front_matter).

To define your note's front matter, the title of your note in this case, start your note with:

```mdx
---
title: "My title"
---
  
# My Note
  
This is the rest of my note here.
```

It is the 3 `---` characters at the start of the file that tell mdx to interpret this block as yaml, which is then used by Fluster for a variety of tasks. The fields that front matter supports will grow considerably as the customizability of Fluster expands, and I hope these front matter fields can be another tool for user's to get the most from Fluster.
