title: Special Files
---


Fluster uses a few 'special' files for various tasks. These files are either specified to Fluster via the app itself (bibliography), or found via file name.

## The Main Folder

In the settings page and during the onboarding process, you can set the primary folder that your notes are contained within. This is used by several internal functions as a sort of container that Fluster should treat as it's data source.

While not strictly required in all cases, these following files _should_ be nested within your _main folder_ for portability.

### Ignoring Things

You can create a `.flusterIgnore` file in the root of your notes directory to specify file paths that fluster should, you know... ignore. The syntax is identical to that of a `.gitignore` file. Documentation on this syntax can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). Be aware however that currently, ignored files will still be discoverable via the file path search[^1].

### Bibliography

#### Bibtex file

By default Fluster includes support for an embedded bibliography database. This database can work in sync with a local file, reading from this file to populate your database, making Fluster interoperable with bibliography management apps that support exporting to bibtex like Zotero.

#### Citation Format

An optional file path to any valid `.csl` file. There is a great repo available [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) with a file to satisfy just about every popular format. 

To apply your selected citation format, simply copy the contents of your chosen `.csl` file to any file within your notes diretory, and then go the bibliography settings page and edit the Csl file path to apply this format to Fluster.
