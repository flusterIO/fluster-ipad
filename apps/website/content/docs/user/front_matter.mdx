title: Front Matter
---


Mdx incorporates the notion of _front matter_, a section of _usually_ arbitrary [yaml](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html). Fluster defines a specific set of front matter fields that you can use to customize the way Fluster handles your notes.


| Field | Description | Type |
| ----- | ----------- | ---- |
| title | This is used inside of search results. If none is found, Fluster will attempt to derive one from your file's content. | `String?` |
| summary | A brief summary of the note that is displayed with search results and utilized by Fluster's AI. | `String?` |
| id | Any unique string, so long as it doesn't have any white space that identifies this note. This can be used to link to this note using the `[](noteId:xyz` syntax. | `String?` | 
| tags | Add tags to your front matter as well as inside of your note. How you apply them is up to you. You can use the `FrontMatterTags` component to show these tags inside of your note, but the navigation will work regardless of whether or not they are visible. | `[]String?` |
| subject | Set subjects in your front matter as well as through smart filters. |  `String?` |
| topic | Set topics in your front matter as well as through smart filters. | `String?` |
| sequentialId | An optional unique id used to make notes part of a sequential list. | `String?` |
| sequentialIndex | If the note is part of a sequential list, this sets the notes index within that list. Start indices at either 0 or 1 and count sequentially from there. | `int?` |
