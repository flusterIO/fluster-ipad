# Fluster - iPad

> Since this app might never make it into produciton, here's a poem from Gemini because Swift is hard.

In realms of code, where logic's spun,
A dev named Byte, his battles won.
With TypeScript's dance and Rust's embrace,
He coded with a joyful grace.

Go's concurrency, a simple art,
And Python's charm, right from the start.
Even Dart, with Flutter's bright gleam,
Was but a sweet, delightful dream.

But then came Swift, a language grand,
A puzzling beast across the land.
"Optionals!" he'd cry, with furrowed brow,
"Why must you vex me, here and now?"

`map` and `forEach`, a simple plea,
But `padding` in SwiftUI? "Oh, dearie me!"
His Xcode crashed, his patience thin,
"Is this a joke? Where do I begin?"

He'd conquer servers, build great apps,
But Swift's UI, a series of traps.
So here's to Byte, a coding star,
Who found his Waterloo, in Swift, afar!
