# Introducing the Fluster blog

Hey everybody! 👋

My name is Andrew and I'm the creator of Fluster. While I'm sitting here waiting for Rust to compile and the Swift emulator to un-freeze, I figured I'd start a blog to share what I've learned. That is the whole point of Fluster after all... to learn more efficiently and to be able to share that knowledge with others.

This blog will be a combination of [[#code]] related posts, and _of course_ some [[#physics]] here and there. I'll do my best to accurately tag everything to make things a bit easier to find, but if you're into Swift, Rust, Typescript, Python or you're just curious about gravity... bookmark this blog!

## The plans for Fluster

Fluster has taken a long, twisted journey to get to where it is now, but the plans for the future are finally well laid out. 

> Unfortunately, for the time being, the support for Windows and Linux systems is going to be limited. 

The reason for this is simple: I'm broke, I'm homeless, and focusing on Apple's ecosystem provides the greatest return on time investment. The upside to this is that Fluster will become ***significantly*** more capable over the coming months.

Currently I'm working on an iPad app written directly in Swift that will allow Fluster to include hand-drawn sketches with the amazing set of tools that Apple provides to developers. To be honest, as a former server & web developer it's _amazing_ the tools that Apple provides right out of the box. With this new focus on Apple's ecosystem, we'll be able to implement:

- On device AI, even on mobile devices.
- Hand drawn sketches with first-party Apple libraries. This will provide the same smooth and seamless drawing experience you're used to on Apple devices.
- All of Apple's text related tools to help you write better, more descriptive notes.
- Seamless integration between your mdx notes and hand-drawn notes. Each note contains a 'paper' view that you can use to draw whatever your note requires, and an mdx file which you can of course use for more text-centered notes.

The advantages to doing things this way are numerous. First, you'll be able to create your note in whichever way suits your needs best. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, Fluster can pass your markdown notes to language models both on your mobile device, your desktop, and eventually, via larger & more powerful server based models. Since LLMs work only with text this removes the need to convert your hand-drawn notes to text via OCR, which is flawed at best.

> Even if you don't _need_ markdown associated with your hand-drawn notes, consider writing some details in this pane so that AI can gather data from your notes. The large language models will not be aware of content in your hand-drawn sketches. This may change at some point, but for the foreseeable future this will be the case.
