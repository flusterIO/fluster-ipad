This model is too important to pass by, and I'm thankful that you're open minded enough to consider the possibilities.\n\nI've tried the academic approach previously, so now I'm just going to assume that everybody reading this has zero knowledge of relativity and walk you all the way through to understanding the flaws in our current interpretations and the solutions that I am proposing. Keep an open mind, think about the concepts deeply, and by the end of this I hope that some of you will see the Universe in a new light. \n\nThis may be long, but it's worth the read.\n\n\n**For the physics students/professionals:** It's relativistic simultaneity. Resolving this absurdity while still allowing for the experimental validations of both SR and GR gives a set of 3 equations yielding both our cosmological and kinematic velocities from local gravitational parameters alone to within 0.5% of direct observation, the mass within the Universe to an accuracy of $2\\sigma$, and a _possible_ relationship to $\\phi$ as a dimensionless rate of spatial dilation.\n\nIf you already have a solid grasp of traditional models of relativity you may want to start at the end where a simple thought experiment is given to demonstrate the case for classical simultaneity. If classical simultaneity is true while $\\gamma$ is applied to the $d=vt\\gamma$ equivalence, the model being proposed is the only possible solution.\n</Admonition>\n\n\n## Some Prerequisite Knowledge\n\n### Special Relativity & Time Dilation\n\nFirst, let's break down the difference between the generalized and specialized theories of relativity. This requires an understanding of a few concepts, but I promise, if you passed high school algebra you can follow the remainder of this note. Some calculus does make an appearance, but the concepts are what matters... not your ability to do the actual math.\n\nSpecial relativity refers to a set of phenomena that occur due to relative motion and the (_kind of_) fact that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames. General relativity has to do with the addition of gravity to this model through a theory known as the [equivalence principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_principle). The equivalence principle simply put states that there is no measurable difference between being in a gravitational field that accelerates an observer at $n$ meters per second, and being in a completely gravity-free environment while in an elevator accelerating upwards at $n$ meters per second. If the magnitude is the same, gravity simply _is_ this acceleration.\n\n\nNext, let's break down why exactly the speed of light is presumed to be constant so we can later dissect this claim in more detail. Spoiler: _It's only half true._\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nc = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nHere, $c$ represents the speed of light, $\\mu_0$ the magnetic constant, and $\\epsilon_0$ the electric constant. The magnetic and electric constants are often referred to as the permeability and permittivity of free space, respectively. Both of these _'constants'_ act as a scalar of the electric and magnetic forces, but more importantly, both have units proportional to length.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n \\epsilon_0 = \\left[ \\frac{F}{m} \\right] \\qquad  \\mu_0 = \\left[ \\frac{H}{m} \\right]\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nWhere $F$ is a _Farad_, $H$ is a _Henry_, and $m$ is a meter. The square brackets are used only to imply the equality is demonstrating units.\n\n> The fact that both of these _constants_ have units proportional to length will become important soon. Consider taking some time to think about how the geometry of these units relates to the equivalence principle and cosmic inflation.\n\n#### Time dilation due to relative motion\n\nEinstein was famous for quite a few incredible discoveries, and he deserves credit for even the one which I am attempting to disprove. I am not proposing that his theory was completely wrong. In fact it was far, far closer to the truth than any of his contemporaries, but his insistence on a static Universe (a Universe that is not expanding) early in his career led him to miss the obvious. Throughout the remainder of this note I will attempt to help you see the mistake that he made, but first, we must cover what he did right. The next few paragraphs will walk you through a derivation that follows the derivation provided by Einstein himself to the best of my ability without going into the details of the Maxwell equations, electromagnetism and vector calculus.\n\nImagine shooting a laser straight up and down from the floor of some spaceship. Thinking of this as being in a spaceship is important for it's lack of gravitational field. This will become incredibly important as we move forward and integrate gravity into this model.\n\nAt some height $h$ above that laser, place a mirror, and another mirror where the laser is placed (this isn't technically possible because the laser would be occupying that space. Pretend that the laser is like a ghost for the sake of this thought experiment). At the end of this thought experiment we should have a pair of mirrors with a laser bouncing between them, straight up and down. Imagine that each unit of time, $t$, occurs over the period that a photon is in transit between one mirror and the other.\n\n<Admonition title=\"The speed of causality\" type=\"info\" foldable sidebar right>\nThere's nothing truly special about the speed of light directly. What matters is the speed of causality, the ability for one event at some position $\\left( x_{0},\\ y_{0},\\ z_{0},\\ t_{0} \\right)$ to affect an object or an observer at another position, $\\left( x_{1},\\ y_{1},\\ z_{1},\\ t_{1} \\right)$. Since $c$, the speed of light is the fastest possible way for us to become aware of some distant event, $c$ is _equivalent_ to the speed of causality. **This** is why time appears to dilate due to the constant nature of the speed of light, but is it really constant?\n</Admonition>\n\n\n\nSo that 'time clock' we set up a couple paragraphs ago? Let's set that in motion now, literally. Imagine that we are now in a _different_ spaceship. \n\nAll of the physics majors are likely screaming right now, waiting for me to tell you how the entire basis of relativity is that all motion is relative and that there is no such thing as absolute rest or absolute motion, but I'm here to tell you that this is wrong. In fact, this is ***not*** the way we treat motion mathematically. In reality, physics carves out a unique niche for gravity, one where all motion is calculated relative to the underlying gravitational field, so that's what we should do here: The spaceship you are in is at rest relative to the local gravitational acceleration.  This is equivalent to the free fall frame from the reference frame of a body in co-motion with the 'dough', but a rest frame in the coordinate system of the 'oven' as the 'dough' dilates around the observer.\n\nNow since we're far out in outer space, far away from any stars or planets in this thought experiment we can pretend that gravitational acceleration is zero. This is a core piece of special relativity, but don't worry... we'll add gravity back in the next section.\n\n\nNow imagine that we are at rest in spaceship $A$, while spaceship $B$ (containing the light clock) zooms past us in a straight line and a constant speed at velocity $v$. That light clock we just made is no longer a line straight up and down, but a triangle. We can use this, the _'constant'_ speed of light, and the Pythagorean theorem to find:\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nt_{\\prime}^2 v^2 + t^2 c^2 & = t_{\\prime}^2 c^2 \\\\\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2} + \\frac{t^2}{t_{\\prime}^2} & = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{t^2}{t_{\\prime}^2} & = 1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2} \\\\\nt_{\\prime} & = t \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis factor of $1/\\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$ is such an important part of relativity that it gets it's own symbol, $\\gamma$ (_gamma_).\n\nAnd that's it! You've successfully derived time dilation due to relative motion, or did you? That's what modern physics would tell us, although many pompous academics would take issue with the simplistic derivation, but let's break down what we ***actually*** discovered here.\n\nFirst, we have the emission of the photon from the 'laser'. Let's say that this event occurred at $\\left( x_{0},\\ y_{0},\\ z_{0},\\ t_{0} \\right)$. We then have the second event, let's say at $\\left( x_{1},\\ y_{1},\\ z_{1},\\ t_{1} \\right)$.\n\n\nTime dilation is only 1 possible solution here. What we have really discovered is the Euclidean distance between these two events is elongated by an additional factor of $\\gamma$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{distance} = \\text{velocity}\\cdot \\text{time} \\cdot \\gamma\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nSo we are left with two possible solutions:\n\n1. Time, a quantity we have never directly measured, and a quantity we aren't even sure exists in any physically meaningful manner dilates.\n2. Space dilates with time. This coincides perfectly with the notion of cosmic inflation (the expansion that gives us the Big Bang model), and as you will soon see, allows us to collapse cosmic inflation, gravitational acceleration and time itself into a single process as observed from different reference frames. Some units have to change to modify quantities that are proportional to time, making them instead proportional to motion or other processes that are currently proportional to time, but all experiments validating current models of relativity are satisfied due to the $d=vt\\gamma$ equivalence that both models seek to maintain.\n\n\nTo be clear, what I am proposing is that time doesn't dilate with relative motion. In fact, I'm claiming that time doesn't exist at all, that time exists only as a ratio of distances. In turn, many of the attributes currently attributed to time become attributed to motion, making motion the 4th fundamental rate of change. In other words, space dilates as a function of the magnitude of motion and the mass of each body, and this dilation of space _is_ time. If the collective motion in the coordinate system of the 'oven' for all bodies within the Universe equals zero, the passage of time ceases. Due to our co-motion across the temporal (time) axis we don't perceive this dilation of distance directly, but we _do_ experience this dilation as gravitational acceleration. So on that note, let's add gravity back into this equation.\n\n### General Relativity & New physics\n\n> **Beware:** Calculus... but not much\n\n<Admonition title=\"Introducing Gravity\" type=\"info\" foldable>\nIn this section we will attempt to demonstrate the equivalence principle and the relationship this principle has to the model I'm proposing. In short, we can derive a dilation of space that is of the precise magnitude required to produce our local gravitational acceleration. From this derivation we can substitute this equation for $\\gamma$ as it represents the same phenomenon in a different reference frame, solve that equation for velocity, and what do you know... it matches direct observation with an error margin of less than 0.5%! This works because the dilation of space due to relative motion ***is*** gravity.\n</Admonition>\n\n\nSo far we've only reviewed what Einstein himself gave us. His brilliance in finding the additional factor of $\\gamma$ in the simple $d=vt\\gamma$ equivalence gives us the opportunity to derive our velocity here on Earth in two distinct forms, but first we must discuss how a single body can have two different velocities.\n\n\nTo dive deeper into the relationship between cosmic inflation, gravitational acceleration and time let us use some common analogies. The most common analogy you're likely to hear for cosmic inflation is that of a loaf of raisin bread or a blueberry muffin. If we imagine a piece of dough placed into an oven, each blueberry will move away from the center of the dough at a velocity that is proportional to the distance that the blueberry was from the center when the dough was placed into the oven. If the berry started further from the center, it will move away from the center faster as all of the dough in between the berry and the center of the dough expands. \n\nThis concept gives us our notion of _cosmological velocity_: Our velocity that takes into account this dilation of space. In this notion of velocity, it is not the motion of the berry _through_ the dough that matters alone, but rather the cumulative motion of both the berry's motion through the dough and the motion of the dough itself.\n\nOur _kinematic velocity_ is different, being made of only the motion _through_ the dough. \n\n#### Cosmological Velocity\n\nFirst, let's start with our cosmological velocity. The following is our standard equation for gravity\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{g} = G \\frac{M \\cancel{m}}{R^2} \\hat{R}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n<Admonition title=\"Mass Independence\" type=\"info\" foldable sidebar right>\nHere I am crossing out the second factor of mass. Because of the manner that this equation is applied in standard physics, this second mass is cancelled and the equation becomes as if the second object is not directly affected by the dilation of space around the primary object. This of course becomes reciprocal, giving rise to a gravitational field of apparent acceleration while the secondary object remains at rest relative to the 'oven'. It is my position that this additional factor of mass helps to hide the true nature of gravity, and that applying this factor that ends up being cancelled anyways is flawed. This does not effect the math at all, but it _does_ effect the physics.\n</Admonition>\n\nAbove, $\\vec{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the gravitational source, $R$ is the distance from the center of mass of the gravitational source, and $\\hat{R}$ just gives the acceleration a direction.\n\nIf we then take the derivative (break things into really, really small pieces) of this equation with respect to radius[^5] we find\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta = 2 G \\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R_{\\oplus}^3}\\hat{R}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAbove, $\\oplus$ indicates that a value pertains specifically to Earth, and $\\delta$ (_delta_) is an arbitrary variable used for this equation elsewhere. By taking the derivative of this equation we've found another equation that when integrated (adding up all of the really, really small pieces) we get an acceleration of gravity that matches precisely with what we experience.\n\nWe're getting closer, but as $\\gamma$ is applied as a scalar, we should take the average of the integral of this equation. If you're unfamiliar with calculus, we are adding up all of the small changes in distance that would occur according to the model being proposed, and taking the average of the sum of all of these small changes to give us a scalar that we can apply to distance in a way that is symmetric with the manner in which $\\gamma$ is applied. This allows us to essentially exchange the two variables as they describe the same phenomenon in a different reference frame, and can now both be applied as scalars.\n\nThe average of this integral gives us:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{1}{R} \\int 2 G \\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R_{\\oplus}^3}\\ dR = 1 + G \\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R^3_{\\oplus}} = 1 + \\frac{g}{R_{\\oplus}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis means that we can now solve $\\gamma$ for $v$ to find\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nv = \\sqrt{c - \\frac{1}{\\gamma}} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{c - \\frac{1}{\\left( 1 + G \\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R_{\\oplus}^3} \\right)^2}} = 526.6 \\ \\frac{\\text{km}}{\\text{sec}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nThe above value falls almost [perfectly on top of probability curves](https://www.flusterapp.com/docs/my_work/on_the_gravitational_nature_of_time) found through direct observation, but we're not done! We can derive our kinematic velocity too.\n\n#### Kinematic Velocity\n\nBefore we dive into the derivation for the kinematic velocity we first need to dig a little deeper into the muffin analogy. Imagine the muffin baking in the oven. If there was some coordinate system in the oven, and a coordinate system in the muffin, there is exactly 1 position within the muffin that does not move relative to the oven as the dough expands, assuming that the 'muffin' is not in motion with respect to the oven along any of the three spatial dimensions. If we expand that analogy to our Universe, we will call that point $p_{\\alpha}$... essentially \n\n$$\np_{\\alpha} = \\left( x_{\\alpha},\\ y_{\\alpha},\\ z_{\\alpha},\\ t_{\\alpha} \\right) = \\left( 0,\\ 0,\\ 0,\\ 0 \\right)\n$$\n\nThis point $p_{\\alpha}$ now would be expanded to contain the entire Universe as the Big Bang model describes, but there is one key difference in the model I am proposing: This point exists concurrently to our own, separated only by some deviation across this density axis. In other words, the 'dough' started out as the ultra-dense early Universe that gives us the Big Bang model, but that 'dough' will be the size of the Universe at which ever time is in question. The 'dough' ***is*** the Universe. \n\nThis concurrent nature of time should be pretty self evident, even in existing models of relativity and, I argue, has been demonstrated [experimentally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafele%E2%80%93Keating_experiment). Consider two observers, $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$. If $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$ are initially very near one another so that they come close to sharing the same coordinates, $O_{a}$ and $O_{b}$ would exist at a shared time coordinate. If $O_{b}$ however was to be set into motion, $\\gamma$ is applied, making it so that $O_{b}$ has progressed further along the time axis than $O_{a}$. While both existed once at a shared position along our temporal axis, they now exist concurrently at different time coordinates.\n\nIf we modify the equations above so we instead define $g$ not as proportional to time, but as proportional to motion _through_ space we reach the cusp of the model I'm proposing: Motion occupies the 4th fundamental rate of change, ***not*** time. That is to say that for some small motion _through_ the 'dough', the 'dough' dilates by some small quantity that is a function of that motion _through_ the 'dough'. The faster (greater magnitude since there is no concept of time anymore) an object moves _through_ the dough, the faster the dough dilates.\n\nSo let us slightly modify the equation for our cosmological velocity to take into account this proportionality to motion, removing the dependence on time. This in turn removes the expansion of the 'dough', giving us our kinematic velocity.\n\nFirst though, we must define a 'time equivalent' quantity, since we are removing time from the equation (literally and figuratively).\n\n\n**Time equivalent quantities:**\n\n<Admonition title=\"For the math types\" type=\"warn\" foldable sidebar right>\n$\\dot{x}$ does not indicate a time derivative in the traditional sense. Instead, it indicates a ***fundamental*** change in displacement. This occupies the role that time previously held as a driving rate of change instead of a rate of change that is proportional to another. In the model being proposed _motion_ occupies this 4th fundamental rate of change, while the 4th temporal coordinate is indicated by a coordinate along the spatial density axis this model demonstrates.\n</Admonition>\n\nIf the 'dough' dilates as a function of the magnitude of a body's motion _through_ the 'dough', and this process when summed over for all bodies within the Universe gives us cosmic inflation, there is no need for some abstract quantity we naively call time. We can define time purely as a ratio of these distances... the distance a body travels _through_ the dough, and a distance that two nearby points diverge from each other. To be more precise, our temporal coordinate is a position along this density axis. This ratio is what gives us the perceived acceleration due to gravity, cosmic inflation, and the perceived passage of time. When $ds/dx$ is greater than 1 we produce what we now consider a blackhole, however these blackholes are nothing more than a mirage in the distance that dissipates as an observer approaches that gravitational field, dilating $c$ proportionally to $g$.[^3]\n\nIn it's integral (adding up all of the small changes) form, this might look like:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n \\Delta  \\tau = \\frac{\\int_p \\dot{x}}{\\int \\dot{x}}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis notation is likely confusing, so let me explain. The denominator indicates the change in displacement integrated over a single unit of \"time\", giving a measure of length equivalent to the velocity in units of length, while the subscript $p$ indicates an integral that continues to grow as the Universe progress temporally.\n\nTo put this in human language, there is no time anymore. There is only motion _through_ the \"dough\", and motion _of_ the \"dough\". When each small motion _through_ the \"dough\" is added up over all of the time in question, we get $\\int_p \\dot{x}$. This number will be proportional to time in our standard units of measure, but there is no need for time in the physical sense. Our attribution of time is largely arbitrary, albeit proportional to the rate of cosmic inflation as we currently define cosmic inflation as being proportional to time. This relationship of course becomes inverse, but this is irrelevant as $ds/dt = 1$. Since the dilation of space _is_ time, this ratio will always be 1, making the inverse of this relationship irrelevant. This is precisely why gravity lacks any apparent [aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_(astronomy)), and why the dilation of space remains hidden from us due to our co-motion along this density axis.\n\n**Time Derivative Equivalent:**\n\nConsider that for $\\int \\dot{x}$ as it appears in equation above, $1$ unit of _pseudo-time_ will pass. Because the passage of pseudo-time is _defined_ by the relationship between proportional derivatives and distances, where $t_{p}$ indicates 1 unit of pseudo-time in units applied to the traditional notion of velocity, we can easily infer the following:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\tau_o = \\frac{1 ~ t_{p}}{dt_p} \\equiv \\frac{\\int \\dot{x}_\\sigma}{dx_\\sigma}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThis gives $\\tau_o$ time derivatives per unit of time, but more importantly, a time derivative, $1/\\tau_o$ that is proportional to $dx$ if $\\int x$ is defined by $dx$.\n\nTo put this simply, we can derive an exactly proportional time-equivalent derivative so that we can remove time, and in turn cosmic inflation from the cosmological velocity derivation above.\n\n**Applying the time equivalent quantities to find our kinematic velocity:**\n\n\nIf $\\delta$ is the dilation of space in it's derivative form, let's apply the time equivalent derivative to this equation. This will make this equation proportional to motion, not time, in turn removing the motion which is only secondary to the dilation of space.\n\nSince $\\delta$ in traditional models is proportional to time, $\\delta$ in it's current form represents the dilation of a small quantity of space over a single unit of time, whatever the unit of time applied to $\\delta$ may be.[^4] Since $v$ is also proportional to a single unit of \"time\", we can find a proportional value of\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\delta^\\prime = 2 G \\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R_{\\oplus}^3} \\frac{1}{v} \\tau\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nWhen we then integrate this in the same manner in which we did to find the replacement for $\\gamma$, we will now have to integrate twice. First over a unit of pseudo-time, and then over the radius. This gives us the sum of the dilation of space for each small quantity of space, for the sum of each small quantity in time, in the coordinate system of the 'dough'.\n\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n \\delta_\\alpha & = \\frac{1}{R_{\\oplus}} \\int \\int_0^{R} \\left[ 2 G \\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R_{\\oplus}^{3}} \\frac{1}{v_{0}} \\tau \\right] ~ dR\\ d\\tau \\\\\n & = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} G\\frac{M_{\\oplus}}{R_{\\oplus}^3} = 371.4 ~ \\text{km} ~ \\text{s}^{-1}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nOur observed velocity relative to the [CMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) (the _dough_ in this model) is approximately $370 ~ \\text{km}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, and some gravitational _\"turbulence\"_ would be expected to give a reasonable margin of error.\n\nFor the math types out there, it is important to note that the integral of $\\tau$ is treated uniquely, as the denominator of $\\tau$ remains fixed in the same manner as when $\\tau$ was first defined. This is due to the nature of this quantity, being proportional to time. Because our units of time are largely arbitrary it is required, but not unfounded to divide the proportional integral $\\int_p$ by a unit of length equivalent to the velocity in units of length to align this quantity with our measures of time. This maintains $\\tau$ as a quantity that is equivalent to time, both in integral and derivative form, and allows that certain quantities remain directly hidden from us as our co-motion along this temporal axis causes our measuring apparatus to dilate along with the objects which we are attempting to measure. This is not some mathematical bandaid, but rather a remedy to an additional derivative we've arbitrarily added to the equation that is not an inherent part of the Universe: time.\n\n\n## Supportive Observations & Related Phenomena\n\n### Pound & Rebka\n\nThe [Pound-Rebka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound%E2%80%93Rebka_experiment)[[cite:PoundRebka]] experiment was an experiment carried out at Harvard in which researchers setup a light clock, not too dissimilar from the one we've setup in our previous thought experiment. The difference (at least the difference that matters) is that they moved the two 'mirrors' apart from each other at a velocity that would perfectly cancel out the [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) induced by gravity. They found a result of \n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nv \\approx g \\frac{h}{c}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nAnd because $t = d/v$\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nv \\approx g \\Delta t\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, $\\Delta$ (_delta,_ I know, we've already used delta) just means the 'change of' $t$, and $h$ is the height between the emitter and the receiver.\n\nAnd you've likely guessed it, this coincides _perfectly_ with the outcome we would expect in the model in which $h$ dilates according to our motion through space which in turn gives the dilation of space and the passage of time, and we did so without the need to dilate a quantity that we can't even measure!\n\nFurther, since both $h$ and $c$ would dilate proportionally to $g$ ($\\gamma$, but $\\gamma$ in integral form gives rise to $g$) in the model I'm proposing, it is irrelevant which coordinate system we use to calculate $\\Delta t$ as both are equivalent. In fact $d/v$ remains constant between reference frames much in the same manner that 4-vectors remained constant in traditional models of relativity\n\n### Bullet Cluster\n\n> Image hosted by [Caltech](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March15/Roos/Roos15.html). They have no affiliation with this app or this model.\n\nThe bullet cluster is a pair of galaxy clusters rapidly approaching each other. The extreme relative velocities accompanied by the extreme masses of each galaxy cluster give rise to a phenomenon that current models of relativity can't explain: The mass we see does not align with the gravitational lens.\n\n![Bullet Cluster](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March15/Roos/Figures/figure18.jpg)\n\nThis sort of 'washing' effect is precisely what would be expected in a model in which gravity, and in turn the gravitational lens is a function of not mass alone, but of mass and velocity.\n\n\n### Lack of Gravitational Aberration\n\nThe apparent lack of gravitational [aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_(astronomy)) seems to imply that the speed of gravity is infinite, but this can't be the case. If 'time' passes and gravity effects some distant body, it must be that either gravity does not 'move' at all, or that gravity and time are the same thing.\n\nIf gravity and time are the same process when observed from the coordinate system of the 'oven', $ds/dt = 1$, regardless of the units used or any relativistic effects, and any motion of space remains hidden from our perspective in the coordinate system of the 'dough'.\n\n\n### Super Evolved Galaxies\n\nWith the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope in 2021 we've made quite a few incredible observations that require some additional context, if not entirely new physics. One of such discoveries is that of galaxies which appear to be [too large](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-023-01937-7) to exist at the time at which we observe them. \n\nBecause light has to travel to us, the further away an object is the further in the past it was when the light that reaches our eyes or telescope departed that object. This problem of super-evolved galaxies at a time which appears to be too early for our current $\\Lambda CDM$ model is resolved by the concurrent nature of this density axis being proposed. If this axis is concurrent, there is no reason to believe that there should be any limit on the evolution of a cosmic process at any point in time.\n\n### Fine Tuning and the Fermi Paradox\n\nThis geometry opens an entirely new concurrent dimension that life may be spread across. It now becomes possible that life exists at some location, separated only by this density axis. If you're the super-natural type, this concurrent density axis might explain certain unexplained phenomena. Everything from ghosts to the propulsion and plausibility of extraterrestrial visitors becomes more likely if an object may exist at shared spatial coordinates, separated only by a density axis coordinate. \n\nThis model of concurrency can be extended to preclude that in order to make an object's existence linear, all that is required is a 4-dimensional coordinate for each density state. This model of concurrency does not explicitly require that an object must follow a linear path in 3-dimensional space. While the temporal axis in this model is not orthogonal, this density axis shares many properties with our 3 spatial coordinates. There is nothing to prohibit an object from traveling backwards in time, so long as the progression of $\\Psi$ (below) progresses linearly (down to the Plank scale) towards $\\infty$.\n\nIn other words, as the Universe expands there exists a (assumingly linear, or at least linear down to the Plank scale) density axis with $n$ possible density states. Of course $n \\approx \\infty$ if this axis is truly linear, but even a finite $n$ trends towards $\\infty$ as the Universe expands. Each object can exist at any density state $\\omega$ within ${{0<\\omega<n}}$ while $n \\mapsto \\infty$. This position of $n$ as it trends to $\\infty$ gives a sort of higher-dimensional time without requiring an additional physical process. An object's existence is linear so long as it has a 4-vector for each state of $n$, with the temporal coordinate not being necessarily equivalent to $n$. This is to say that the coordinate system of the past, present and future exist concurrently. To borrow a phrase from Einstein, _\"The distinction between the past, present and future is nothing but a stubbornly persistent illusion\"_.[[cite:Einstein_Besso_Letter]]\n\nI will now refer to this progression of $n \\mapsto \\infty$ as $\\Psi$. $\\Psi$ is equivalent to the least dense state possible at any instant.\n\nIn regards to the super-evolved galaxies described above, there is no reason to infer that _our_ origin at $p_{\\alpha}$ was concurrent with another distant body. A body may have existed at this more dense state for a much longer dilation of $\\Psi$, allowing for this seemingly excess temporal progression, and this body may have existed long before our own origins at $p_{\\alpha}$. If this axis is concurrent, there is no reason to believe that the instant we were at $p_{\\alpha}$ was concurrent to any other body. This is to say that our reliance on distance to determine the age of a body is completely flawed. There is no requirement that the distant body that emitted the light we are observing was existing at a shared temporal coordinate when it emitted the photon being received.\n\nTo summarize, I believe that our position along this proposed density axis exists as a sort of yet unresolved equilibrium solution. This may resolve the fine-tuning paradox while opening the door to a completely new dimension of travel with sufficient technological advancements.\n\n- An object must have a 4-vector for each density state $\\omega$\n- This density decreases according to $\\sum g$ (gravitational acceleration of every body in the Universe) as a function of $v$.\n- An object does not have to exist _at_ $n$. Instead, an object may exist at any density between the original density state of $p_{\\alpha}$ and $n$.\n  - This is what allows for super-evolved galaxies. There is nothing to exclude a body remaining at a higher density state for a greater period of $\\Psi$, and nothing to require that our position at $p_{\\alpha}$ was concurrent to another body's.\n\n### Machian Inertia\n\nThis model in which cosmic inflation is derived from the sum of all gravitational acceleration gives rise to a completely Machian interpretation of inertia. As Newton's laws dictate, every force should be met with it's opposite. If this inflation gives rise to time itself due to an object's motion through the oven's coordinate system, giving an equilibrium solution in the coordinate system of the 'dough', it's opposite should resist a change from this equilibrium state. If Newton's first law _is_ this equilibrium state, any deviation from this state should be resisted by the opposite of the dilation of space.\n\nFor body $A$, this may be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{g} = \\int_0^R 2 G \\frac{M_{A}}{R_{A}^{3}}\\hat{R}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nBut $A$ would be met by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{Inertia} = \\sum \\int_0^R 2 G \\frac{M_{A}}{R_{A}^{3}}\\hat{R}\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nWhere $R$ in the latter equation is the distance from the secondary body to $A$. It is this sum that gives rise to Machian inertia, and _I believe_, the source of mass.\n\n\n### Classical Simultaneity\n\nThis one is not so much an experiment, but rather an absolutely ridiculous notion that falls out of current interpretations of special relativity. Resolving this absurdity was perhaps the single greatest motivation in the development of this model. This notion, known as relativistic simultaneity, says that a single, instantaneous event can occur at two different points in time. This just falls out of the math of special relativity, and since _most_ of the math of special relativity has been demonstrated experimentally, it is widely, albeit inexplicably accepted. This is obviously absurd, not only as a matter of physics, but as a matter of math. Through the modifications to special relativity being proposed we can remove this notion, maintaining that all instantaneous events occur at precisely one instant in time.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\n### Problems & Shortcomings\n\nFirst, this model will, by the very nature of the symmetries it shares with existing models of relativity, satisfy _all_ experiments supporting existing models. That is not to say that all the math has been resolved. In the narrow view we can say that all vectors have the same magnitude, some are pointing in the exact opposite direction, but if that is the case the opposite body is moving (space, not the object when it is in gravitational free fall). This gives the same kinematic velocity in both models. Cosmological velocities are a little harder to demonstrate, but by the very symmetries that this model shares with current models, all experiments _must_ be satisfied. That is not to say that the math is easy. In fact, deriving a set of equations for a body in motion through a medium that dilates as a function of that motion, putting space itself in motion is proving to be really, _really_ hard. I know I can do it, but with me being homeless I haven't been able to dedicate time to this model in almost a year as I've worked on releasing Fluster.\n\n#### Conservation of Energy and Momentum\n\nAs the section on Machian inertia implies, inertia is zero when the body is in motion with the 'dough'. If the body moves relative to the oven but the body's motion relative to the dough is zero, the total forces on the body are zero, giving rise to Newton's first law. \n\n### Variable speed of light\n\nSo, have you noticed the inconsistency yet? If the speed of light is constant in each reference frame, how can it possibly be a constant if either space or time dilates? If $t = d/v$ and either $t$ or $d$ dilates, it is impossible for $c$ to be both an absolute constant and equivalent in each reference frame. What is possible however is that $c$ is equivalent in each reference frame, as $c$ dilates proportional to distance as space itself dilates. This gives a measure of $c$ that both observers would agree on, but this is only due to the dilated space of the observer in motion. The kinematic velocity of $c$ is equivalent in each reference frame, not the velocity in the coordinate system of the 'oven'.\n\n\n### The Blackhole Mirage\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries in modern physics is how to describe the interior of a blackhole. Current models suggest that the interior of a blackhole is a point of infinite density, a place where even light can't escape. In the model I am proposing, blackholes are nothing more than a mirage in the distance that dissipates as an observer approaches that body's gravitational field, causing the speed of light to dilate proportionally. As only the speed of light _through_ the 'dough' is constant in each reference frame, inversely proportional to the density of the 'dough', the speed of light increases proportionally to local gravitational acceleration. This fits perfectly with what is observed in the Pound & Rebka experiment once our co-motion across the temporal axis is accounted for. Even the curvature of light ***away*** from the gravitational source in the gravitational lens follows this pattern.[^1]\n\n### The key to moving forward\n\nIn short, this model needs to be bound with electromagnetism. The potential outcome of such a unity would change the world on par with the wheel or the discovery of electricity. Through this new description of gravity, cosmic inflation and time we can infer that the divergence of the magnetic field is **not** 0, but rather equivalent to the determinant of some time dependent 3x3 matrix that describes the dilation of space at that point. In a manner that is similar to the way in which the dilation of space remains hidden apart from the apparent acceleration due to gravity, our co-motion keeps this divergence hidden from us directly. Through this relationship I am confident that gravity and electromagnetism can finally be unified.\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla B = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\nabla B = \\delta \\left|\\begin{array}{ccc}\n    1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n    0 & 0 & 1\n    \\end{array}\\right|\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nThere also exists an intriguing coincidence, where if we treat $v$ as being not proportional to time, but as the fundamental rate of change mentioned above, making $v$ a pure magnitude of distance proportional only to other velocities where $d/v = 1$, we can derive a ratio of\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{ds}{dx} \\approx 1.618 = \\phi\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\n\nfor a set of local gravitational parameters that occurs on the surface of Earth, where $ds$ is the dilation of space per the change in displacement of magnitude $v$. Oddly enough this quantity can be found through a peculiar pairing of our equatorial and polar radii to an accuracy of $\\pm 0.004\\%$.\n\nTreating $v$ as being only proportional to other magnitudes leads to a theoretical upper limit of $c$ in units of length, making the magnitude of each vector _not_ purely relative in the same manner that motion is currently thought to be. Instead the free-fall reference frame leaves an observer at rest relative to the 'oven', making all displacement vectors (arrows describing the change in your location) being relative to this reference frame, and the magnitude of each vector being proportional to $c$ in that coordinate system.\n\n#### To The Physics Students and Professionals\n\nFirst, thank you for actually reading this, despite what you may think about it. Secondly, yes... I know this is radical. It's a geometry that's hard to wrap your head around, and it leads to several uncomfortable conclusions:\n\n- Gravity is a repulsive force\n- Gravity is a function of velocity\n- We've had one too many derivatives this whole time\n\nAnd most significantly, _nothing_ can be proportional to time. The implications of this are huge, but they are not unmanageable or inconsistent with observation. Every quantity we define as being proportional to time can be rewritten as being proportional to something else, even if that just is motion on a relativistic scale. This opens the door to science-fiction level possibilities... imagine every quantity being proportional to a quantity that **we can directly influence**. Imagine a real, quantifiable geometry to time itself.\n\n\n### The Lighthouse And The Clock-tower - A closing thought experiment\n\nNow that you understand the principles of relativity, lets go through a thought experiment: Let there be two observers, $A$ and $B$. Let these two observers agree that $B$ should travel at some agreed upon velocity $v$ between two arbitrary points in space, $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. At $p_{2}$ place a time keeping device that remains visible from $p_{1}$. As $A$ remains at $p_{1}$ and watches $B$ in motion between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, at what time will $B$ reach $p_{2}$? \n\nSurely both observers must agree on the time at which $B$ reaches $p_{2}$, which I will now call $t_{\\omega}$. If we were to place a camera at $p_{2}$ that captures $B$ arriving at $p_{2}$, this image must agree with the time $A$ observes $B$ reach $p_{2}$ since there are no relativistic effects impacting the image returned from $p_{2}$ to $A$ at $p_{1}$. We also ***know*** that $\\gamma$ must apply to this equation. [Pound & Rebka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound%E2%80%93Rebka_experiment)[[cite:PoundRebka]], and [Ives & Stillwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ives%E2%80%93Stilwell_experiment)[[cite:IveStillwell]] have both demonstrated this additional factor of $\\gamma$ experimentally.\n\nSo if $t_{\\omega}$ must be $t_{0} + d/v \\gamma$ where $d$ is the distance between $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, $t_{0}$ the initial time, and $v$ is the ***agreed upon*** velocity, the only possible solution to the $d=vt \\gamma$ equivalence is that _distance_ dilates in the coordinate system of $B$ and that $A$ and $B$ <Ul yellow>can't</Ul> agree upon a velocity. If both $A$ and $B$ must agree on the time at which $B$ reaches $p_{2}$ and this time must be extended by an additional factor of $\\gamma$, then the agreed upon velocity produces an elongated distance while the velocity decreases by a factor of $1/\\gamma$ in the coordinate system of $A$ to accommodate a $d$ that is not elongated by $\\gamma$. It's as if there exists some sort of drag induced by the more dense coordinate system, and in a manner similar to the way in which 4-vectors remain constant in traditional models of relativity, $d/v$ remains constant irrespective of coordinate system.\n\n\n[^1]: The metric tensor, in the way it is currently applied, appears to describe this motion due to Einstein's reliance on the equivalence principle and the addition of vectors.\n[^3]: See the section on the Pound & Rebka results. $c$ dilates proportionally to $\\gamma$ according to the function that gives $g$. A fundamental piece of this model is the principle that all functions limit at their Newtonian counterpart when the reference frame is shared, once this divergent geometry is accounted for. No where is this more evident than in the \"constant\" nature of $c$. With $c$ being constant _in_ each reference frame, it is _impossible_ for it to be equivalent **between** reference frames when the units of measure themselves are dilating.\n[^4]: $s^{-2}$ in standard units. The dimensionality issue with $\\dot{x} \\mapsto \\ddot{x}$ is discussed in the section on the conservation of energy and momentum.\n[^5]: For each small change in the radius, there is a dilation of space equivalent to this function.\n",

    "content": "---\ntitle: Welcome to Fluster!\nid: welcomeToFluster\n---\n\n# Welcome to Fluster!\n\nMy name is Andrew, and I'm the creator of Fluster. Please take the time to look through these initial notes as they contain all of the information you need to get the most from Fluster!\n\n> This is a sample note designed to get you familiar with what Fluster has to offer!\n\n### Fluster's Back Story\n\n> See the attached note with [[#defaultNotes]] tag for more details if this intrigues you. Fluster came to be almost entirely as an effort to force this model into the physics debate.\n\nWell, it's a long story. To sum it up, I think I Einstein was wrong about an assumption he made early in his career, and I think I can demonstrate the flaws in this assumptions convincingly. In the winter of 2022 I had a realization about this assumption and I spent the next few months exploring the potential solutions further. It was then that I realized I could derive our velocity here on Earth (_both_ of them... explained in the attached note) to an almost undeniable accuracy through this modification to Einstein's work and our local gravitational parameters alone. I then gave up my career as a software engineer to pursue this model full time, becoming homeless for more than 3 years in the process.\n\nOver the course of this pursuit I built my own note taking application, the original version of Fluster for my personal use. As the application grew and grew I decided to release it as a free & open source application, and now 4 years later we arrived at the version of Fluster you see before you now. This app will always be my own personal note taking solution, and as such it will remain under active development with new features added often.\n\n\n## What makes Fluster unique?\n\nAs Fluster was built originally for my own personal academic pursuits, I built this application to follow my own workflow. Working on a modified model of relativity required generating plots, sketches of diagrams, equations, and of course... text, and I built Fluster to accommodate each of these methods.\n\nTo accomplish this, Fluster relies on [mdx](https://mdxjs.com), a superset of markdown that allows for embedding [React](https://react.dev) components directly within your notes. This works because Fluster embeds your note's rendered markdown in a webview container, allowing you to extend your markdown notes to include content designed for the web. Fluster includes a set of components by default, but plugin functionality will be enabled once the Fluster MacOS application has been rewritten in Swift.\n\n\n## Why should I use Fluster?\n\n### 1) Options\n\nBecause you have a lot of different things to jot down, search and reference later. Being built by a former software engineer pursuing my own goals in cosmology, I've tried my best to to design Fluster to reflect the often chaotic and jumbled workflows of modern academics. Instead of keeping sketches in one app, with typed notes in another, Fluster keeps your sketches and markdown content side-by-side. By keeping this content separate but linked we allow artificial intelligence to digest the parts of your notes that they handle best, while giving you the freedom to choose the input method that works best for you.\n\n### 2) Search Functionality\n\nWhen I decided to build a note taking application instead of using existing options I was driven by one unfortunate fact: All existing options either had reasonable search features but lacked in STEM related features, or they were great for STEM focused work and lacked the searching and organization capabilities that I required.\n\nTo get around this, Fluster extends upon other navigation methods to allow you to link and search notes in the way that works with your use case. \n\n- First, Fluster allows adding bibliography entries to each of your notes. By adding a bibliography entry and then linking that entry to 1 or more notes, you can search first by bibliography entry before returning notes linked to that entry.\n- Second, Fluster allows you add add 'taggables' to each note. A 'taggable' is just a term I use internally within the app to reference a topic, a subject, or a tag. Each note can have as many tags as you like, being inserted directly into the content with the `[[#myTagHere]]{:mdx}` syntax, an optional subject and an optional topic. Each 'taggable' is then searchable within the app, easily guiding you to related notes.\n- Third, Fluster includes traditional search methods like full-text search with special ranking methods used to sort content that appears to match your query more significantly given the note's content. Search results appearing in more semantically significant markdown blocks will appear ahead of those that briefly mention the subject.\n\n### 3) Future Proofing\n\nAs somebody that is passionate about physics and driven by a deeper understanding of the Universe, I will always be a student of some sort and Fluster will always be my note taking application. This means that features will be added often, from a developer that is also a daily user of the application. If you notice a bug or find room for improvement, chances are that I do too and this will lead to rapid improvements in the application and related tools (Python, GO and Typscript SDK coming soon as well as a CLI).\n\n### 4) You just need more\n\nFluster was built originally by me and for me. This means that I was able to include some features that might be on the complicated end of the spectrum for some users, but the tradeoffs are worth it if you are willing to put the time in to learn mdx. Mdx is really only slightly more complicated than markdown, and all regular markdown syntax will work exactly as it would in a markdown application, but for those power users that really need the most from their note taking application mdx opens the door to completely new possibilities. \n\nFluster includes a set of components for you to use right out of the box, and this list will continue to grow. From interactive plots, to mermaid diagrams, to syntax highlighted code blocks, Fluster lets you include more complicated content than markdown alone would allow.\n",
