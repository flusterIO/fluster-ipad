# Start Here!

My name is Andrew, and I'm the creator of Fluster. Please take the time to look through these initial notes as they contain all of the information you need to get the most from this app, as it's pretty unique among note taking applications. On first launch, there will be the following notes:

1. **Introduction:** This is what you're reading right now.
2. **Components:** A note going over the available mdx components. There are snippets to help, but this is a quick visual reference.
3. **Reference:** A quick syntax reference. It's probably worth keeping this around until you become familiar.
4. **On The Gravitational Nature of Time:** Consider this a demo if you like, but this is a short summary of the model that inspired the creation of Fluster. The note assumes no further knowledge than basic calculus, and does my best to take the reader from Einstein's work to a modified model of relativity that gives a set of equations providing both our kinematic and cosmological velocities to well within measurement error. The problem? Gravity becomes a respulsive force. [Avi Loeb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CvQxOmwAAAAJ) couldn't get that past peer review, so here we are... re-building a note taking application for the 4th time while homeless to promote the model. Feel free to just delete this if you like, but this is the reason Fluster even exists.

## Fluster's Strategy

While in most cases user's don't care much about the architecture of the application they're using, it's relevant for Fluster. Fluster uses [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/), a superset of markdown with added support for [React](https://react.dev/) components. Fluster provides a growing list of components for you, with snippets available to help speed up typing and searchability.

Here's the thing, MDX is _really_ powerful. So powerful so, that it's difficult to replicate the functionality of MDX in Apple's native language, Swift. The logical question then is well, why not just do everything in the language that makes MDX happy, Typescript? The answer, is that while Apple's support for rendering complex math and other complex components from a 'markdown' file is extremely limited, it's support for things like the Apple pencil, onboard AI, and other first-party features are unbeatable.

The strategy Fluster takes is simple, to give users the most functionality possible by providing both rendering methods in a single application
