# Welcome to Fluster!

My name is Andrew, and I'm the creator of Fluster. Please take the time to look through these initial notes as they contain all of the information you need to get the most from Fluster!

> This is a sample not designed to get you familiar with what Fluster has to offer!

### Fluster's Back Story

Well, the **TLDR** is:

1. Got my masters in astrophysics
2. Late one night came across an assumption made by Einstein and spent the next month examining this assumption in further detail.
3. Realized this model has incredible potential, already giving multiple directly observed quantities to well within measurement error, and as a result I decided to leave my career in software to pursue this model.
4. Became homeless for almost 4 years, now living in a homeless shelter.
5. Became frustrated with existing note taking options, so I built my own for my own personal use to accommodate my own studies.
6. Reworked my own personal app into a series of applications culminating in the Fluster you see before you to draw attention to the model, since the model reaches some controversial conclusions (gravity is a _repulsive_ force, space dilates... _not_ time.).

## What makes Fluster unique?

As Fluster was built originally for my own personal academic pursuits, I built this application to follow my own workflow. Working on a modified model of relativity required generating plots, sketches of diagrams, equations, and of course... text, and I built Fluster to accommodate each of these methods.

To accomplish this, Fluster relies on [mdx](https://mdxjs.com), a superset of markdown that allows for embedding [React](https://react.dev) components directly within your notes. This works because Fluster embeds your note's rendered markdown in a webview container, allowing you to extend your markdown notes to include content designed for the web. Fluster includes a set of components by default, but plugin functionality will be enabled once the Fluster MacOS application has been rewritten in Swift.


## Why Fluster?

Well, in short, because you have a lot of different things to jot down, search and reference later. Being built by a former software engineer pursuing my own goals in cosmology, I've tried my best to to design Fluster to reflect the often chaotic and jumbled workflows of modern academics. Instead of keeping sketches in one app, with typed notes in another, Fluster keeps your sketches and markdown content side-by-side. By keeping this content separate but linked we allow artificial intelligence to digest the parts of your notes that they handle best, while giving you the freedom to choose the input method that works best for you.

### Search Functionality

When I decided to build a note taking application instead of using existing options I was driven by one unfortunate fact: All existing options either had reasonable search features but lacked in STEM related features, or they were great for STEM focused work and lacked the searching and organization capabilities that I required.

To get around this, Fluster extends upon other navigation methods to allow you to link and search notes in the way that works with your use case. 

- First, Fluster allows adding bibliography entries to each of your notes. By adding a bibliography entry and then linking that entry to 1 or more notes, you can search first by bibliography entry before returning notes linked to that entry.
- Second, Fluster allows you add add 'taggables' to each note. A 'taggable' is just a term I use internally within the app to reference a topic, a subject, or a tag. Each note can have as many tags as you like, being inserted directly into the content with the `[[#myTagHere]]{:mdx}` syntax, an optional subject and an optional topic. Each 'taggable' is then searchable within the app, easily guiding you to related notes.
- Third, Fluster includes traditional search methods like full-text search with special ranking methods used to sort content that appears to match the content more significantly given the note's titles.
